### **Difference Between Named Slots and Scoped Slots**

#### **Named Slots**
- **Purpose**: Named slots allow you to define multiple slots in a child component and give each slot a specific purpose or label (e.g., `header`, `footer`).
- **Behavior**: The parent provides content for these slots by matching the slot’s name in a `<template>` block (e.g., `<template #header>`).
- **Data Flow**: Named slots **do not share any data** between the child and the parent; they are purely placeholders for static content.

**Key Idea**: Named slots are just labeled containers for content that the parent provides, with no dynamic data involved.

#### **Scoped Slots**
- **Purpose**: Scoped slots allow the child to pass **dynamic data** to the parent’s slot content. The "scope" here refers to the **data or variables exposed by the child** to the parent inside the slot.
- **Behavior**: The parent accesses this scoped data by using a slot prop (e.g., `v-slot="{ data }"`) and decides how to render the content dynamically.
- **Data Flow**: Scoped slots enable the child to send dynamic information (like items in a list or details of a grid) back to the parent, so the parent can customize how the child’s data is displayed.

**Key Idea**: Scoped slots pass data from the child to the parent’s slot, allowing dynamic rendering of content in the parent.

### **What Does "Scope" Mean in Scoped Slots?**
In the context of scoped slots, "scope" refers to the **variables or data made available by the child to the parent**. These variables are tied to the scope (context) of the child component and can include dynamic information, computed properties, or functions. The parent accesses this "scope" through the slot props and uses it to render customized content.

### **Example to Highlight the Difference**

#### Named Slots Example (Static Content)
```vue
<!-- Parent -->
<ChildComponent>
  <template #header>
    <h1>Static Header</h1>
  </template>
  <template #footer>
    <p>Static Footer</p>
  </template>
</ChildComponent>

<!-- Child -->
<template>
  <div>
    <header><slot name="header"></slot></header>
    <footer><slot name="footer"></slot></footer>
  </div>
</template>
```
- The parent provides content for the `header` and `footer` slots.
- No data is shared between the child and the parent.

---

#### Scoped Slots Example (Dynamic Data)
```vue
<!-- Parent -->
<ChildComponent>
  <template #default="{ item }">
    <div>Dynamic Content: {{ item.name }}</div>
  </template>
</ChildComponent>

<!-- Child -->
<script setup>
const itemData = { name: 'Scoped Slot Item' };
</script>

<template>
  <slot :item="itemData"></slot>
</template>
```
- The child sends `itemData` to the parent through the slot scope (`:item="itemData"`).
- The parent dynamically renders the content using the scoped `item` data (`{ item }`).

---

### **When to Use Each**

- **Named Slots**: Use when you need **static, labeled placeholders** for content. For example, defining reusable layouts like a modal, card, or template with `header`, `body`, and `footer` sections.
  
- **Scoped Slots**: Use when the child has **dynamic data** that the parent needs access to in order to customize the display. For example, when building components like lists, grids, or tables, where the child manages the structure but the parent customizes how the data is displayed. 

### **Summary**
- **Named Slots** = Labeled static containers.  
- **Scoped Slots** = Child shares dynamic data with the parent for customized rendering. The "scope" is the data exposed from the child.
